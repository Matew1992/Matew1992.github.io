NFL Touchdown Game:
NFL Touchdown is probably the worst experience you will ever have in an american football game RPG.
The sole purpose for this game to exist is because i had to develop it for a "school" project.

use the left, right, up and down arrow to controle the player, get to the other side and score a Touchdown before 
the opponents tackles you and get you injured!!
Score 5 poins to become the new NFL Champion!! but be careful, every point you score, the harder the game becomes!

ENJOY # American-Football-Game
